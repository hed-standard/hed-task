# Causal Learning Task

**HED Task ID:** `hedtsk_causal_learning`

**Also known as:** Contingency Judgment Task, Contingency Learning Task, Causal Judgment Task, Causal Induction Task, Delta-P Task, Allergy Prediction Task

Participants observe cue-outcome pairings across trials and judge the causal strength of the relationship; judgment profiles across contingency conditions index causal induction and associative learning mechanisms.

## Description

Causal learning tasks measure how people acquire and represent causal relationships from observed co-occurrences. In the standard contingency judgment paradigm, participants observe a series of trials in which a candidate cause (e.g., a food, a medicine, a button press) is either present or absent and an outcome (e.g., an allergic reaction, a health improvement, a light turning on) either occurs or does not. After observing multiple trials, participants rate the causal strength of the relationship (typically -100 to +100 or 0 to 100). The normative benchmark is delta-P (P(outcome|cause) - P(outcome|no cause)), but human judgments systematically deviate: they are sensitive to outcome density, show cue competition effects (blocking, overshadowing), and are influenced by prior causal beliefs. Associative models (Rescorla-Wagner) and statistical models (causal power; Cheng, 1997) compete to explain these patterns. The paradigm bridges associative learning, causal reasoning, and Bayesian inference literatures. It is the human analogue of animal conditioning studies and is foundational for understanding how people learn cause-effect relationships in medicine, engineering, and everyday reasoning.

* - **Procedure**
  - Participants observe a series of trials presenting the presence/absence of candidate causes and occurrence/non-occurrence of outcomes, then judge the causal strength of cause-outcome relationships.
* - **Manipulation**
  - Contingency (delta-P value: positive, zero, negative); outcome base rate (common vs. rare outcomes); cue competition (blocking, overshadowing, relative validity); number of trials; trial-by-trial vs. summary presentation; number of candidate causes; temporal contiguity between cause and outcome.
* - **Measurement**
  - Causal strength ratings; trial-by-trial prediction accuracy; judgment latency; sensitivity to contingency components (P(O|C) and P(O|~C) separately); blocking magnitude; correspondence between judgments and normative models (delta-P, causal power, Rescorla-Wagner).

## Variations

* - Variation
  - Description
* - Allergy Prediction Task
  - Cover story: patients eat foods and develop (or don't develop) allergies. The most common contingency learning cover story. Naturalistic and intuitive framing.
* - Blocking Paradigm
  - Pre-train cause A → outcome, then present compound AB → outcome. Test causal rating for B. Blocking (low B ratings) demonstrates cue competition and supports associative models.
* - Outcome Density Manipulation
  - Vary the base rate of the outcome (P(O|~C)). High outcome density inflates causal ratings even at zero contingency (outcome density bias).
* - Trial-by-Trial Prediction
  - Participants predict the outcome on each trial before seeing it. Prediction error drives learning. Allows modeling of trial-by-trial associative strength updating.
* - Summary vs. Sequential Presentation
  - Summary: all contingency information presented simultaneously in a table. Sequential: one trial at a time. Different formats can produce different judgments (format effect).
* - Multi-Cause (Relative Validity)
  - Multiple candidate causes present; some perfectly predictive, others partially redundant. Tests relative validity and cue selection.
* - Causal Direction Manipulation
  - Predictive (cause → effect: given cause, judge effect likelihood) vs. diagnostic (effect → cause: given effect, judge cause likelihood). Tests asymmetry in causal reasoning.
* - Backward Blocking / Retrospective Revaluation
  - Post-training information about one cause changes judgments about a previously trained compound partner. Tests whether causal knowledge is updated retrospectively.
